# engi

engi is a multi-platform 2D game library for Go, forked from [ENGi v0.6.0](http://ajhager.com/engi).
After much bitrot and many broken builds, I have ported it to be a thin wrapper over Ebiten.

This is mainly to ease the transition from old engi to Ebiten. I didn't bother porting stuff I didn't use.

There is pretty much no reason to use this unless you are trying to resurrect and old engi game.
Use [Ebiten](https://ebiten.org/) instead.
